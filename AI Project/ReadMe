Optimizing Cyber Security Techniques for Large Infrastructures using Genetic Algorithm

Abstract
The project addresses the optimization of cybersecurity rules using Genetic Algorithms.
The algorithm evaluates and evolves hexadecimal chromosomes representing
cybersecurity rules strategies against simulated attacks. Diverse initialization, selection
techniques, crossover, and mutation were employed to iteratively enhance the fitness
of solutions, culminating in a robust defense mechanism.

Problem Statement
Cybersecurity defense mechanisms must evolve to counteract ever-advancing attack
strategies. Optimizing these mechanisms is a complex problem due to the diverse and
dynamic nature of cyber threats. Hence, we have tackled this problem by implementing
it in Genetic Algorithm, which aims to optimize cybersecurity rules to converge to a best
solution that is effective against the everchanging landscape of cybersecurity attacks.
Proposed Solution
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was developed to optimize cybersecurity rules represented as
hexadecimal chromosomes. Each chromosome represents a security configuration: the
first four digits represent the detection rate, the next four digits represent the resilience
of the system against attacks, and the remaining two digits representing the response
time.

Methodology
The algorithm begins with a diverse population of chromosomes to prevent premature
convergence. Then, it employs a fitness function to the chromosomes to see which ones
are the best performing ones. We implemented a hybrid approach in our selection
function, from generations one to ten, it uses a Roulette Wheel Selection to choose the
chromosomes for crossover, and then Rank-Based Selection after the tenth generation
as that is when convergence starts to appear. Hence, when fitness values are similar to
each other, using a rank-based selection was the appropriate choice. The algorithm
incorporates crossover to generate offspring by blending traits from superior parents,
promoting variability. To further ensure genetic diversity, mutations are applied at
specified rates, introducing new potential solutions and avoiding local optima. Iterative
evaluations and enhancements over successive generations refine the solutions,
culminating in optimized defence strategies against evolving threats.

The Genetic Algorithm was implemented with the following parameters:
• Population Size: 50
• Chromosome Length: 10 (hexadecimal)
• Generations: 30
• Crossover Rate: 8%
• Mutation Rate: 5%

Key steps include:
1. Initialization of population.
2. Fitness evaluation using a weighted formula based on detection rate, system
resilience, and response time.
3. Roulette Wheel and Rank-Based Selection.
4. Single-point crossover and mutation for diversity.
5. Iterative evolution over 30 generations.
6. Attack success rate calculated based on the inverse of the effectiveness of the
defense system.

Results
• The fitness of solutions improved over generations, converging to an optimal
fitness value.
• The algorithm identified security rule configurations with increased defense
effectiveness and reduced attack success rates.

Conclusion & Future work
The project demonstrated that Genetic Algorithms are a viable approach to optimizing
cybersecurity mechanisms. By iteratively evolving strategies, the algorithm improved
defense effectiveness, as evidenced by fitness scores and reduced attack success rates.
Future work could include extending the algorithm to incorporate real-time adaptive
mechanisms and scaling it for more complex threat landscapes.
Real-Time Adaptation: Modifying the algorithm to react dynamically to real-time data
inputs, such as emerging attack patterns or changes in system vulnerabilities.
Scalability for Complex Threats: Extending the algorithm to optimize defense
mechanisms for complex threats such as in enterprise networks or cloud environments,
where multi-layered defense strategies are required.
By embracing these directions, the applicability and effectiveness of Genetic Algorithms
in cybersecurity can be further enhanced, driving innovation in automated defense
mechanisms.
