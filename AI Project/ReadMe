Optimizing Cyber Security Techniques for Large Infrastructures using Genetic Algorithm

The project addresses the optimization of cybersecurity rules using Genetic Algorithms.
The algorithm evaluates and evolves hexadecimal chromosomes representing cybersecurity rules strategies against simulated attacks. Diverse initialization, selection 
techniques, crossover, and mutation were employed to iteratively enhance the fitness
of solutions, culminating in a robust defense mechanism.
